## How To Build

You will need ubuntu, git, around 8GB RAM and bla-bla-bla...

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ sudo apt install -y bash git make libssl-dev curl bc pkg-config m4 libtool automake autoconf

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Gojikovi/kernel_samsung_universal9611

# Go into the repository
$ cd kernel_samsung_universal9611

# Install toolchain
# You could try any clang/LLVM based toolchain, however I use neutron clang
# If you are using Arch or distro with latest glibc, You may want to use antman instead.
$ bash <(curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/roynatech2544/0feeeb35a6d1782b186990ff2a0b3657/raw/b170134a94dac3594df506716bc7b802add2724b/setup.sh)

# If you want to compile the kernel not for A51 then export DEVICE variable to m21, m31, m31s, f41, gta4xl
# Build the kernel
$ ./build_kernel.sh aosp # (for AOSP)
$ ./build_kernel.sh oneui # (for OneUI)
$ DEVICE=m21 ./build_kernel.sh aosp # (for M21, AOSP)
```

After build the image of the kernel will be in out/arch/arm64/boot/Image

## How To Flash

After a successful build, you can see the scripts/packaging/Grass*.zip archive.
This is your kernel. Just flash it via TWRP or adb sideload
